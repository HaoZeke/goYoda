**Check the output [here](https://github.com/HaoZeke/docuYoda_Starter/blob/pdf/spooky-action.pdf).**

This is a consolidation of both the [docuYoda](https://github.com/HaoZeke/docuYoda_Starter) and [zenYoda](http://zenyoda.surge.sh/) projects.

As such this is to be distributed as a single binary written in go, which enables high level rendering of markdown or other documents powered by pandoc.

Both pandoc style citations and traditional TeX citations are enabled, however keep in mind that TeX citations will not display in non-TeX files.

Read about the project at it's source [here](https://www.github.com/HaoZeke/docuYoda) or on the documentation site [here](https://docuyoda.surge.sh).

For creating presentations, refer to the sibling project, [zenYoda](http://zenyoda.surge.sh/) and it's [starter template](http://zenyodasap.surge.sh/).

## Goals

* Single binary
* Supports templates
* Easily extensible
* Automatic output
* Integration with surge or netlify for presentations
* Focus on presentations, reports and flashcards
* Interactive and file based configuration
* Continuous compilation
